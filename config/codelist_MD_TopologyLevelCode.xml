        <code>topology1D</code>
        <definition>1-dimensional topological complex; commonly called 'chain-node' topology</definition>

        <code>planarGraph</code>
        <definition>1-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in a plane in such a way that no two edges intersect except at a vertex.)</definition>

        <code>fullPlanarGraph</code>
        <definition>2-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A 2-dimensional topological complex is commonly called 'full topology' in a cartographic 2D environment.)</definition>

        <code>surfaceGraph</code>
        <definition>1-dimensional topological complex that is isomorphic to a subset of a surface. (A geometric complex is isomorphic to a topological complex if their elements are in a one-to-one, dimensional-and boundary-preserving correspondence to one another.)</definition>

        <definition>3-dimensional topological complex. (A topological complex is a collection of topological primitives that are closed under the boundary operations.)</definition>
