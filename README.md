# metadataFromGeodata
The metadataFromGeodata is a Java application, which reads geographic and quality information from geodata files and
creates metadata files. The application can be used to read OGC Geopackage files (https://www.geopackage.org/),
Esri Shapefiles (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm),
and ASCII (csv) files linked to a Geopackage file.

The generated metadata is ISO 19115-1:2014 (Geographic information - Metadata https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html)
and ISO 19157:2013 (Geographic information - Data quality https://www.iso.org/standard/32575.html) compliant.
Thus, the created XML files can be used as inputs for (geographic) metadata catalogues.

A xml file stores all read metadata and additionally a flattened sqlite database is generated. 
The latter serves as an extension point to generate output in other standard compliant formats.

This project is one result of the project GeoKur. Look at the project page https://geokur.geo.tu-dresden.de/ for further
information.


## Usage
Use the IDE of your choice and build, e.g., a jar file. The package needs one argument - the filename of a property file.
This file must contain all information to run the main method. An example is given in config/propertiesExample.txt.

*Minimum content of a property file*: 
- `geodata = filenameGeodata.xxx` is the file name to geospatial data for metadata extraction
- `outXML = filenameOut.xml` denotes file name for output in xml format. All extracted metadata follow the nested structure
  given in ISO 19115 and ISO 19157. If the file exists it is replaced without asking.
- `outDB = filenameOut.db` is the file name for a flattened view on metadata in SQLite format.

*Optional content of property file for all formats*:
- `profile = filenameProfile.json` provides the path (absolute or relative to executing path + file name) to a Json profile
  containing the used metadata elements for all packages under `org.geokur` plus their obligation. Metadata elements that
  are not used in the profile can be instantiated, but a warning will occur. If a class is instantiated, but misses mandatory
  elements, a warning will occur. If the profile is omitted, a standard profile is used. This allows all ISO entries,
  none of which is mandatory. This results in a run without any notifications about missing or excess metadata elements.
- `allowedFileFormat = xxx` defines a file extension to be allowed (interpreted in the DQ_FormatConsistency). This entry
  is allowed an arbitrary number of times.

In the case of an *ascii file in csv format* more content in the property file must be provided:
- `geodataReference = filenameGeodata.gpkg` gives the file name of the geodata that serves as geographic base data for
  the recent ascii file. Currently only geopackage format is allowed.
- `geoTableName = tablename` denotes a table in the geopackage to be interpreted. Multiple entries are allowed.
- `geoColNameJoin = columnName` a column header in the geopackage. Multiple entries are allowed and are concatenated in
  the order of appearance. The resulting string is used to identify unambiguous elements within the tables in the geopackage.
- `asciiColNameJoin = columnName` means the same like geoColNameJoin, but for the column names in the ascii file (can be
  different names). The order of the entries must be the same as in geoColNameJoin.
- `asciiColNameDefine = columnName` these entries designate the column name for definition of temporal, thematic, or
  additional contents. Further analysis of data quality use these columns.
- `descriptionAsciiColNameDefine = thematic/temporal/additional` gives the description whether columns in asciiColNameDefine
  are of thematic, temporal, or additional type. The order of asciiColNameDefine and descriptionAsciiColNameDefine must
  be given accordingly. Multiple entries for each type are allowed and will be concatenated internally.
- `asciiColNameIgnore = columnName` indicates a column to be ignored. Multiple entries are allowed.
- `colJoinNumerical = true/false` if the joining criteria can be interpreted numerically and at least one criterion can
  be interpreted as sequence a faster table masking version is tried. 
- `colJoinSequential = true/false` indicates whether the columns used to join the table entries to geographic entities
  can be interpreted as an incremental sequence. The number of entries shall be the same as geoColNameJoin or asciiColNameJoin.
- `postgresUse = true/false` if true, a postgresql database is used to derive data quality elements from csv content
  -> faster and for larger files the only useful decision
- `postgresHostname = 127.0.0.1` hostname for postgresql database
- `postgresDatabase = databaseName` name of postgres database
- `postgresUser = userName` name of postgres user
- `postgresPasswd =` password for postgres user (can be left empty if login equals postgres user)
- `thematicMapping = true/false` if true a mapping from thematic IDs according to a mapping dictionary is done.
- `thematicMappingFile = filename.csv` ascii file with the mapping from the ID to a string.
- `thematicMappingColFrom = colname` column name of IDs in thematicMappingFile.
- `thematicMappingColTo = colname` column name of target strings in thematicMappingFile.


## Structure
The metadataFromGeodata project is structured into several packages:
- `org.geokur` contains the main method in the class MetadataGenerator.
- `org.geokur.generateMetadata` contains central classes for each supported geospatial format (Geopackage, Asciidata, Shape).
- `org.geokur.ISO191xxProfile` contains classes and exceptions for profiling the metadata schema for individual use cases.
- `org.geokur.ISO19103Schema` contains classes from ISO 19103:2015 (geographic information - conceptual schema language).
  Only a small set of classes is included (Coordinate, DirectPosition, Record, RecordType). These classes are necessary for
  correct instantiating classes from ISO 19115 and ISO 19157.
- `org.geokur.ISO19107Schema` contains classes from ISO 19107:2019 (geographic information - spatial schema). These classes
  describe the representation and manipulation of spatial characteristics of geographic entities. Only classes ISO 19115
  and ISO 19157 refer to are included.
- `org.geokur.ISO19111Schema` contains classes from ISO 19111:2019 (geographic information - referencing by coordinates).
  Included are only classes ISO 19115 and ISO 19157 refer to.
- `org.geokur.ISO19115Schema` contains classes from ISO 19115-1:2014 (geographic information - metadata). Using these classes
  provides a standardized way for metadata representation.
- `org.geokur.ISO19115_2Schema` contains classes from ISO 19115-2:2019 (geographic information - metadata - Extension for
  acquisition and processing). These classes extend ISO 19115-1 in regard to specific requirements for observational data.
- `org.geokur.ISO19157Schema` contains classes from ISO 19157:2013 (geographic information - data quality). These provide
  comprehensive information about data quality of the described dataset. Referring to comparable data quality measures
  the data user can evaluate the dataset's fitness for the specific use.
  
  
## Output File Structure
*xml file*
- the root element is `DS_DataSet` according to ISO 19115
- all namespaces from the ISO norms are declared
- next element `has` is a field of class `DS_DataSet` and leads to the next element
- `MD_Metadata` indicates one geospatial resource; shape files allow only one resource, geopackages enable an arbitrary
  number of resources and thus `MD_Metadata` elements
  
*SQLite database*
- the database consists of several tables: datasets, namespaces, properties, and a metadata linking table plus metadata
  content table for each geospatial dataset (one in case of shape, possibly multiple in case of geopackage or csv)
- datasets table lists all geospatial datasets
- namespaces contains all used namespaces
- metadata linking table (e.g., exampleGeo_gpkg_1) shows the nested structure of metadata elements and fields and links to metadata
  content via metadata_id
- metadata content table (e.g., exampleGeo_gpkg_1_metadata) summarizes all metadata content
- properties allows future extensions


## Extracted Metadata Elements
The following measures can be extracted. The specific quantities depend on the input format.

- *Basic Information*: user name, role, uid, description, file creation date, last update
- *Reference System*: spatial reference system (SRS) defining organization, SRS ID, SRS description
- *Structure of Spatial Data*: metadata creation date, spatial representation type, environmental description, geographical
  extent in source SRS, geographical extent in standard SRS (WGS84, EPSG:4326), median resolution
- *Data Quality*: counts and rates of missing items per attribute, counts and rates of excess items, polygons per area,
  count of temporal units, count of thematic units, empirical distribution parameters of various combinations of spatial-
  temporal-thematic units, format consistency, temporal consistency, non-quantitative attribute correctness
- *Metadata Contact*: link to ISO standard
